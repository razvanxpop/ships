Authentication and Authorization

# Overview
The authentication and authorization layer is designed to:

* Secure user access using a JWT-based mechanism.
* Register new users with encrypted passwords and role assignments.
* Validate login credentials and issue JWTs with an expiration time.
* Authenticate and authorize API requests using a custom JWT filter.

# Registration
The registration process allows new users to create an account. The system ensures:

* Email Uniqueness: Checks whether the provided email already exists in the database.
* Password Generation: A random password is generated, encrypted, and sent to the user via email.
* Role Assignment: New users are assigned the default role (ROLE_USER).
* Email Notification: Sends an email with the login credentials.

## Endpoint:
POST /auth/register

## Request Body:
The RegisterDTO contains:
```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

## Response:

* Success: A message indicating the account was created and an email was sent.
* Failure: An error if the email is already registered or if email delivery fails.
## Code Explanation:

* The register() method in AuthenticationController:
    - Verifies email uniqueness via userRepository. 
    - Calls AuthenticationService.register() to:
      - Create and persist the User.
      - Send the login credentials via email.
      - Handles email-related exceptions (MessagingException).
```java
if (userRepository.findByEmail(registerDTO.getEmail()).isPresent())
    return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST).body("An account with this email already exists");

User user = authenticationService.register(registerDTO);
return ResponseEntity.ok("Your account was created! Check your email");
```

## Login
The login process validates user credentials and generates a JWT for authenticated access.

## Endpoint:
POST /auth/login

## Request Body:
The LoginDTO contains:
```json
{
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

## Response:

- Success: Success: Returns a LoginResponse with the JWT, expiration time, and user details.
- Failure: Returns an error if the credentials are invalid.

Code Explanation:

- The login() method in AuthenticationController:
    - Authenticates the user using AuthenticationManager.
    - Generates a JWT using JwtService.generateToken().

## Code Snippet:

```java
Authentication authentication = authenticationManager.authenticate(
    new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(loginDTO.getEmail(), loginDTO.getPassword())
);
String jwtToken = jwtService.generateToken(user);
return ResponseEntity.ok(new LoginResponse(jwtToken, user.getFirstName(), user.getLastName(), user.isNew()));
```

# JWT-Based Authentication
JWT (JSON Web Token) is used for secure communication between the client and server.

## Features:
* Token Generation: The JwtService generates a JWT containing the username, issued time, and expiration time, signed using an HMAC-SHA256 key.
* Token Validation: Validates the token signature and expiration time before granting access to protected resources.
* Middleware Enforcement: A JwtAuthenticationFilter intercepts each request to ensure that valid tokens are included.
## Token Structure
* Header: Algorithm & Token Type
* Payload: Claims (username, roles, issued at, expiry)
* Signature: Verifies integrity using a secret key.
## Token Generation
The JwtService.generateToken() method creates tokens using:

* Claims for additional metadata.
* A subject (username).
* Expiration settings based on jwtExpiration.
```java
public String generateToken(UserDetails userDetails) {
    return buildToken(new HashMap<>(), userDetails, jwtExpiration);
}
private String buildToken(Map<String, Object> extraClaims, UserDetails userDetails, long expirationTime) {
    return Jwts.builder()
        .setClaims(extraClaims)
        .setSubject(userDetails.getUsername())
        .setIssuedAt(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis()))
        .setExpiration(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis() + expirationTime))
        .signWith(getSignInKey(), SignatureAlgorithm.HS256)
        .compact();
}
```
## Token Validation
The JwtService.isTokenValid() method ensures the token is valid for the given user and has not expired.

# JWT Authorization Filter
The JwtAuthenticationFilter ensures that each incoming request contains a valid JWT for secured endpoints.

## Workflow:

1. Extracts the token from the Authorization header.
2. Validates the token's signature and expiration.
3. Loads the UserDetails and sets it in the security context.
## Code Snippet:
```java
final String jwt = authHeader.substring(7);
final String userEmail = jwtService.extractUsername(jwt);
if (userEmail != null && SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication() == null) {
    UserDetails userDetails = userDetailsService.loadUserByUsername(userEmail);
    if (jwtService.isTokenValid(jwt, userDetails)) {
        UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken authenticationToken =
            new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(userDetails, null, userDetails.getAuthorities());
        authenticationToken.setDetails(new WebAuthenticationDetailsSource().buildDetails(request));
        SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(authenticationToken);
    }
}
```

# Error Handling
The JwtAuthenticationFilter handles exceptions using HandlerExceptionResolver to provide meaningful error messages without exposing sensitive information.

Code Snippet:
```java
catch (Exception e) {
    handlerExceptionResolver.resolveException(request, response, null, e);
}
```

# Security Highlights
* Password Encryption: Passwords are hashed using PasswordEncoder (e.g., bcrypt).
* Role-Based Authorization: Roles (ROLE_USER) are assigned and enforced for access control.
* Secure Communication: Tokens are signed and verified with a secret key.

# Key Dependencies
* Spring Security: For authentication and role-based access control.
* JJWT (io.jsonwebtoken): For JWT generation and validation.
* EmailSender: For sending account-related emails.
