# 3. Authentication and Authorization
This section describes the authentication and authorization processes implemented in the backend server for the client-server application. It includes an overview of user registration, login functionality, and JWT (JSON Web Token) usage for secure authentication.

### Overview
The authentication and authorization layer is designed to:

* Secure user access using a JWT-based mechanism.
* Register new users with encrypted passwords and role assignments.
* Validate login credentials and issue JWTs with an expiration time.
* Authenticate and authorize API requests using a custom JWT filter.

### Registration
The registration process allows new users to create an account. The system ensures:

* Email Uniqueness: Checks whether the provided email already exists in the database.
* Password Generation: A random password is generated, encrypted, and sent to the user via email.
* Role Assignment: New users are assigned the default role (ROLE_USER).
* Email Notification: Sends an email with the login credentials.

#### Endpoint:
POST /auth/register

#### Request Body:
The RegisterDTO contains:
```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

#### Response:

* Success: A message indicating the account was created and an email was sent.
* Failure: An error if the email is already registered or if email delivery fails.
#### Code Explanation:

* The register() method in AuthenticationController:
    - Verifies email uniqueness via userRepository. 
    - Calls AuthenticationService.register() to:
      - Create and persist the User.
      - Send the login credentials via email.
      - Handles email-related exceptions (MessagingException).
```java
if (userRepository.findByEmail(registerDTO.getEmail()).isPresent())
    return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST).body("An account with this email already exists");

User user = authenticationService.register(registerDTO);
return ResponseEntity.ok("Your account was created! Check your email");
```

### Login
The login process validates user credentials and generates a JWT for authenticated access.

#### Endpoint:
POST /auth/login

#### Request Body:
The LoginDTO contains:
```json
{
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

#### Response:

- Success: Success: Returns a LoginResponse with the JWT, expiration time, and user details.
- Failure: Returns an error if the credentials are invalid.

Code Explanation:

- The login() method in AuthenticationController:
    - Authenticates the user using AuthenticationManager.
    - Generates a JWT using JwtService.generateToken().

#### Code Snippet:

```java
Authentication authentication = authenticationManager.authenticate(
    new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(loginDTO.getEmail(), loginDTO.getPassword())
);
String jwtToken = jwtService.generateToken(user);
return ResponseEntity.ok(new LoginResponse(jwtToken, user.getFirstName(), user.getLastName(), user.isNew()));
```

### JWT-Based Authentication
JWT (JSON Web Token) is used for secure communication between the client and server.

#### Features:
* Token Generation: The JwtService generates a JWT containing the username, issued time, and expiration time, signed using an HMAC-SHA256 key.
* Token Validation: Validates the token signature and expiration time before granting access to protected resources.
* Middleware Enforcement: A JwtAuthenticationFilter intercepts each request to ensure that valid tokens are included.
#### Token Structure
* Header: Algorithm & Token Type
* Payload: Claims (username, roles, issued at, expiry)
* Signature: Verifies integrity using a secret key.
#### Token Generation
The JwtService.generateToken() method creates tokens using:

* Claims for additional metadata.
* A subject (username).
* Expiration settings based on jwtExpiration.
```java
public String generateToken(UserDetails userDetails) {
    return buildToken(new HashMap<>(), userDetails, jwtExpiration);
}
private String buildToken(Map<String, Object> extraClaims, UserDetails userDetails, long expirationTime) {
    return Jwts.builder()
        .setClaims(extraClaims)
        .setSubject(userDetails.getUsername())
        .setIssuedAt(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis()))
        .setExpiration(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis() + expirationTime))
        .signWith(getSignInKey(), SignatureAlgorithm.HS256)
        .compact();
}
```
#### Token Validation
The JwtService.isTokenValid() method ensures the token is valid for the given user and has not expired.

### JWT Authorization Filter
The JwtAuthenticationFilter ensures that each incoming request contains a valid JWT for secured endpoints.

#### Workflow:

1. Extracts the token from the Authorization header.
2. Validates the token's signature and expiration.
3. Loads the UserDetails and sets it in the security context.
#### Code Snippet:
```java
final String jwt = authHeader.substring(7);
final String userEmail = jwtService.extractUsername(jwt);
if (userEmail != null && SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication() == null) {
    UserDetails userDetails = userDetailsService.loadUserByUsername(userEmail);
    if (jwtService.isTokenValid(jwt, userDetails)) {
        UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken authenticationToken =
            new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(userDetails, null, userDetails.getAuthorities());
        authenticationToken.setDetails(new WebAuthenticationDetailsSource().buildDetails(request));
        SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(authenticationToken);
    }
}
```

### Error Handling
The JwtAuthenticationFilter handles exceptions using HandlerExceptionResolver to provide meaningful error messages without exposing sensitive information.

#### Code Snippet:
```java
catch (Exception e) {
    handlerExceptionResolver.resolveException(request, response, null, e);
}
```

### Security Highlights
* Password Encryption: Passwords are hashed using PasswordEncoder (e.g., bcrypt).
* Role-Based Authorization: Roles (ROLE_USER) are assigned and enforced for access control.
* Secure Communication: Tokens are signed and verified with a secret key.

### Key Dependencies
* Spring Security: For authentication and role-based access control.
* JJWT (io.jsonwebtoken): For JWT generation and validation.
* EmailSender: For sending account-related emails.

# 4. Database Management
The backend uses PostgreSQL as the database management system, running in a Dockerized environment. PostgreSQL is selected for its robust handling of relational data, support for advanced data types (e.g., JSON, arrays, and large objects), and scalability.

### Key Highlights:
* Relational Database: Follows normalized schema design to reduce redundancy and improve consistency.
* Entity Relationships: Tables are structured to represent real-world relationships, such as users owning pets and scheduling veterinary appointments.
* Large Object Storage: Images are stored in the database using PostgreSQL's OID (Object Identifier) for handling binary data efficiently.

### Data Storage Practices
**2.1 Password Management**
* Passwords are hashed and salted before being stored in the database.
* The application uses PasswordEncoder (e.g., bcrypt) to hash passwords, making them resistant to brute-force and rainbow table attacks.
* Example:
  ```json
  String password = PasswordService.generatePassword();
  user.setPassword(passwordEncoder.encode(password));
  ```

**2.2 Image Storage**
* User profile images are stored as binary data using PostgreSQL's OID (Object Identifier) type.
* The images are first converted into Base64 strings when being sent to or retrieved from the database. This ensures compatibility with JSON-based APIs.
* Conversion Process:
  * To Base64: For API responses, image data is encoded into a Base64 string:
    ```json
    String base64Image = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(user.getImageData());
    ```
  * From Base64: For saving in the database, the image is stored as OID.

**2.3 Relationships and Constraints**
* Users and Roles: One-to-Many relationship.
  * A user can have multiple roles (e.g., ROLE_USER, ROLE_ADMIN).
* Users and Pets: One-to-Many relationship.
  * Each user can own multiple pets.
* Pets and Veterinary Appointments: Many-to-One relationship.
  * A pet can have multiple veterinary appointments, but each appointment is linked to one pet.

### Schema Design
<img src="./images/erd-diagram.jpg" alt="ERD Diagram" height="128" width="128">

### Query Optimization
The application uses JPA (Java Persistence API) for interacting with the database. JPA offers the following advantages:
* Lazy Loading: Relationships are loaded only when needed, reducing unnecessary data retrieval.
* Custom Queries: For complex queries, custom methods are defined in repositories. Example:
  ```java
  @Query("SELECT p FROM Pet p WHERE p.owner.email = :email")
  List<Pet> findPetsByOwnerEmail(@Param("email") String email);
  ```

### Dockerized PostgreSQL
The application uses a Dockerized PostgreSQL instance, ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
**Key Configuration:**
* The compose.yml file defines the PostgreSQL service
  ```java
  services:
  postgres:
    image: 'postgres:latest'
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: 'pawpaw_user'
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: 'pawpaw_password'
      POSTGRES_DB: 'pawpal_db'
    ports:
      - '5435:5432'
  ```
**Advantages**:
* Easy environment replication.
* Persistent volume for database data.

### Example Workflow
User Registration with Profile Image:
1. Input: A user submits their details and an optional profile image.
2. Processing:
   * Image data is received as a Base64 string.
   * Converted to binary and stored in the database as OID.
   * Password is hashed and stored securely.
3. Storage: The user and their data (including the image) are saved in the Users table.
4. Retrieval: When retrieving the user data, the image binary is converted back to a Base64 string and included in the API response.

# 5. Security Features
This section outlines the security features implemented in the backend server to ensure secure access and data protection. It includes configurations for authentication, authorization, password security, and CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policy enforcement.

### Overview 
The application leverages modern security practices to protect sensitive data and ensure secure communication between the client and the server. The key security features include:
* Stateless authentication using JWT.
* Secure password hashing.
* Role-based access control.
* Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration for controlled client-server communication.
* Protection against CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks.

### Authentication and Authorization
The backend uses Spring Security to manage authentication and authorization:
* Authentication Provider: Validates user credentials via the AuthenticationManager and delegates authentication tasks.
* JWT Authentication Filter: Ensures secure access to protected resources by validating tokens.
* Role-Based Access Control: Implements roles (e.g., ROLE_USER) to restrict access to specific endpoints.

#### Configuration:

* Authentication is stateless, meaning no session is maintained on the server. Instead, JWTs are used for client authentication.
* Authorization is enforced at the endpoint level:
  - Public endpoints: /auth/** (e.g., login, registration).
  - Protected endpoints: Require a valid JWT.
#### Code Snippet:
```java
http.csrf(AbstractHttpConfigurer::disable)
    .cors(Customizer.withDefaults())
    .authorizeHttpRequests(auth ->
        auth.requestMatchers("/auth/**").permitAll()
            .anyRequest().authenticated()
    )
    .sessionManagement(session -> session.sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS))
    .authenticationProvider(authenticationProvider)
    .addFilterBefore(jwtAuthenticationFilter, UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class);
```

### Password Security
The system ensures secure password storage and validation by using:
* Password Hashing: Passwords are hashed using PasswordEncoder (e.g., bcrypt), which securely encrypts passwords before saving them in the database.
* Salting: Each password is uniquely salted to prevent attacks using precomputed hash databases (rainbow tables).

#### Code Snippet:
```java
String password = PasswordService.generatePassword();
user.setPassword(passwordEncoder.encode(password));
```

### Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
CORS settings are configured to allow specific client requests to access server resources securely:
* Allows requests from any origin (*), which can be restricted for production environments.
* Permits only specific HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
* Supports Authorization and Content-Type headers for secure communication.

#### Code Snippet:
```java
CorsConfiguration configuration = new CorsConfiguration();
configuration.addAllowedOriginPattern("*");
configuration.setAllowedMethods(List.of("GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"));
configuration.setAllowedHeaders(List.of("Authorization", "Content-Type"));
configuration.setAllowCredentials(true);
```
This configuration is registered for all endpoints using a CorsConfigurationSource bean.

### Stateless Authentication
The application follows a stateless authentication model where:
1. JWT-Based Authentication:
* Each request must include a valid JWT in the Authorization header (Bearer <token>).
* The JwtAuthenticationFilter validates the token and sets the authentication context.
2. Session Management:
* SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS ensures no session is stored on the server.
```java
http.sessionManagement(session -> session.sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS));
```

### CSRF Protection
CSRF attacks are mitigated by disabling CSRF protection for stateless API endpoints. This is safe because the application does not rely on cookies for authentication.

#### Code Snippet:
```java
http.csrf(AbstractHttpConfigurer::disable);
```

### Error Handling
To ensure a secure and user-friendly experience, the JwtAuthenticationFilter handles errors during token validation by using HandlerExceptionResolver. This prevents exposure of sensitive information.

#### Code Snippet:
```java
catch (Exception e) {
    handlerExceptionResolver.resolveException(request, response, null, e);
}
```

### Security Best Practices
* Use Strong Secrets: The JWT secret key is configured securely via application properties.
* Token Expiration: JWTs are issued with an expiration time to limit token misuse.
* Limit CORS Access: While development allows *, production environments should specify trusted origins.
* Secure Passwords: Use a high-strength hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2.
* Monitor for Vulnerabilities: Regularly audit dependencies for security vulnerabilities.

### Key Dependencies
* Spring Security: Provides the foundation for authentication and authorization.
* JwtAuthenticationFilter: Custom filter for validating JWTs.
* PasswordEncoder: Hashes and validates passwords.
* CORS Configuration: Manages client-server communication securely.

# 6. Image Handling
This section explains how the backend server manages user profile images, including how they are processed, stored, and retrieved. The system leverages PostgreSQL for storage and follows best practices for handling binary data.

### Overview
User profile images are an optional feature that allows users to personalize their accounts. The backend supports image upload, storage, and retrieval in a secure and efficient manner.
**Key Features:**
* Image Upload: Images are received as Base64-encoded strings in API requests.
* Database Storage: Images are stored in the database as binary data using PostgreSQL's OID (Object Identifier) type.
* Image Retrieval: Images are converted back to Base64 strings and sent to clients via API responses.

### Image Handling Workflow
**2.1 Uploading Images**
1. Input: The user uploads a profile image in Base64 format as part of their account details.
2. Processing:
   * The Base64 string is decoded into binary data.
   * The binary data is stored in the database under the imageData column in the Users table.
   * The MIME type of the image (e.g., image/png) is stored in the imageType column for easy retrieval.

**Code Snippet**:
```java
public static UserDTO toUserDTO(User user) {
    String base64Image = "";
    if (user.getImageData() != null) {
        base64Image = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(user.getImageData());
    }
    return new UserDTO(user.getId(), user.getFirstName(), user.getLastName(), user.getEmail(), 
                       user.getPassword(), user.isNew(), user.getRoles(), petsDTO, base64Image, 
                       user.getImageType());
}
```

**2.2 Retrieving Images**
1. Fetching:
  * When a user's data is retrieved, the imageData column is queried.
  * The binary image data is converted to a Base64 string.
2. Response:
  * The API includes the Base64 string in the image field of the response.
  * The imageType field specifies the MIME type for rendering.

**Example API Response:**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "image": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUg...",
  "imageType": "image/png"
}
```

**2.3 Deleting or Updating Images**
* When a user's profile image is updated or removed:
  * The existing binary data in the database is replaced or deleted.
  * Updates are seamless since the image is referenced by the user's id.

### Storage Details
**Database Storage**
* Column: The imageData column in the Users table stores binary data.
* Type: PostgreSQL's OID (Object Identifier) type is used for large binary objects.
* Advantages:
  * Efficient storage for binary data.
  * Simplified management of associated metadata (e.g., MIME type).
**Best Practices for Image Storage:**
1. Keep Images Optional:
  Not all users will upload images, so the imageData column allows NULL values.
2. Store Metadata:
  Save the image MIME type (image/png, image/jpeg) in a separate column for compatibility.
3. Optimize Retrieval:
  Convert binary data to Base64 only when needed to minimize overhead.

### Security and Validation
1. File Type Validation:
  Ensure only valid image types (e.g., png, jpeg) are accepted.
  Reject unsupported or potentially malicious files.
2. Size Restrictions:
  Enforce maximum file size limits to prevent excessive database usage.
  Example: Restrict image uploads to 5MB.
3. Base64 Encoding:
  Convert binary data to Base64 strings for compatibility with JSON-based APIs.
4. Environment-Specific Configurations:
  For production environments, consider offloading images to dedicated file storage services like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage for scalability.

### Example Workflow
Uploading a Profile Image:
1. Request: A user sends their profile image (in Base64 format) to the server via a POST request.
2. Processing:
  * Decode the Base64 string to binary.
  * Store the binary data in the imageData column.
  * Save the image MIME type in the imageType column.
3 . Response:
  * A confirmation message is sent to the user

# 7. Email Services
This section describes the email services implemented in the backend server. These services are designed to handle user communication, including account creation, appointment notifications, and reminders. The implementation ensures reliability, scalability, and customizability by leveraging HTML templates and Spring's email capabilities.

### Overview

1. Loads the new_appointment.html template.
2. Populates the template with templateModel variables.
3. Sends the email.

#### Code Snippet:
```java
Context context = new Context();
context.setVariables(templateModel);
String html = templateEngine.process("new_appointment.html", context);
sendHTMLEmail(to, subject, html);
```

#### sendMailForAppointmentReminder
This method sends reminders for upcoming appointments.
#### Parameters:
* Same as sendMailForNewAccount.
#### Workflow:
1. Loads the appointment_reminder.html template.
2. Populates the template with templateModel variables.
3. Sends the email.

#### Code Snippet:
```java
Context context = new Context();
context.setVariables(templateModel);
String html = templateEngine.process("appointment_reminder.html", context);
sendHTMLEmail(to, subject, html);
```

### Dynamic Email Templates
The email service uses Thymeleaf templates to create dynamic and visually appealing emails. Each template is populated with user-specific data (e.g., name, password, appointment details).

#### Template Example(new_account.html):
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Welcome to PawPal</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, [[${recipientName}]]!</h1>
    <p>Your account has been created successfully. Your temporary password is: <strong>[[${generatedPassword}]]</strong></p>
    <p>Please log in and change your password immediately.</p>
    <p>Regards,</p>
    <p>The PawPal Team</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### Configuration
#### JavaMailSender
The JavaMailSender bean is configured with the SMTP server details (e.g., Gmail, SendGrid). It handles email delivery.

#### SMTP Configuration:
* Host: SMTP server host (e.g., smtp.gmail.com).
* Port: SMTP port (e.g., 587).
* Authentication: Senderâ€™s email and password.
* TLS/SSL: Ensures encrypted communication.

### Error Handling
All email-sending methods handle MessagingException, which may occur due to:
* Invalid recipient address.
* SMTP server issues.
* Network interruptions.
### Error Logging: Exceptions are logged to help diagnose email delivery issues.

### Security Considerations
1. Environment Variables:
* Store SMTP credentials (username, password) securely in environment variables or a secrets manager.
2. Rate Limiting:
* Configure rate limits for email sending to prevent abuse.
3. Email Spoofing Prevention:
* Use SPF, DKIM, and DMARC configurations to verify email authenticity.

### Scalability Recommendations
* Asynchronous Email Sending:
    - Use a task queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for processing email requests asynchronously.
* Batch Processing:
  - Group email notifications to reduce overhead.

# 9. FAQ and Troubleshooting
**2.1 Application Fails to Start**
* Error: Database connection refused.
  * Solution: Ensure the PostgreSQL database is running and accessible. Verify the connection string, username, and password in the environment variables.
  * Command to check:
  ```bash
  docker ps 
  ```
* Error Port 8080 is already in use.
  * Solution: Stop the conflicting service or change the application's port in the application.properties file:
  ```
  server.port=8081
  ```

**2.2 Cannot Upload or Retrieve Images**
* Cause: Image data is not being stored in the database or incorrectly encoded.
  * Solution:
    * Verify the imageData column is of type OID.
    * Ensure the image is correctly Base64-encoded before saving.
    * Check for any constraints or size limits in the database.

**2.3 Email Notifications Are Not Sent**
* Cause: Incorrect SMTP configuration.
  * Solution:
    * Verify the spring.mail configuration in the application.properties file.
    * Check the SMTP server logs for errors.
    * For Gmail, ensure "Less secure app access" is enabled for the sender account.

**2.4 JWT Token Validation Fails**
* Error: JWT token is invalid or expired.
  * Solution:
    1. Verify that the SECURITY_JWT_SECRET_KEY in the backend matches the one used to generate the token.
    2. Ensure the token is not expired.
    3. Check the jwtExpiration configuration in the .env file.

****2.5 Deployment Issues****
* Error: Cannot bind to port 5432 for PostgreSQL.
  * Solution:
    * Ensure no other services are using port 5432 on the host machine.
    * Change the exposed port in docker-compose.yml
    ```yaml
      ports:
        - "5433:5432"
    ```
* Error: Cannot pull Docker image from Docker Hub.
  * Solution:
    * Ensure correct Docker credentials are used.
    * Run:
    ```bash
    docker login
    ```

**2.6 Performance Issues**
* Symptom: API responses are slow.
  * Solution:
    * Enable query logging to identify slow queries
    ```properties
    spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.show_sql=true
    spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true
    ```    
    * Add indexes to frequently queried columns (e.g., email, id).
    * Optimize JPA queries using projections.

**2.7 Image Upload Fails**
* Error: File size exceeds the allowed limit.
  * Solution: Configure file size limits in Spring Boot
  ```properties
  spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=5MB
  spring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size=5MB
  ```
* Error: Unsupported file type.
  * Solution: Add validation for allowed file types (e.g., image/png, image/jpeg).

# 10. Appendices
This section provides additional information, resources, and references to support developers and administrators working with the backend server. It includes conventions, file structure, key configurations, and links to external documentation.

**Codebase Structure**
The backend server follows a modular structure for better organization and maintainability.

```

### Naming Conventions
Adopting consistent naming conventions helps improve readability and maintainability.

**2.1 Package Naming**
* Use lowercase letters.
* Structure packages by functionality:
  * controller: For controllers.
  * service: For service classes.
  * repository: For database repositories.

**2.2 Class Naming**
* Use PascalCase for class names (e.g., AuthenticationController, UserService).
* Name entity classes based on the resource they represent (e.g., User, Pet, VeterinaryAppointment).

**2.3 Method Naming**
* Use camelCase for method names.
* Use descriptive names for methods, e.g.:
  * findUserByEmail(String email)
  * createPet(User user, PetDTO petDTO)
**2.4 File Naming**
* Follow the same naming convention as classes.
* Configuration files should reflect their purpose (e.g., application.properties, docker-compose.yml).

### Key Configurations
**3.1 application.properties**
The main configuration file for Spring Boot. Below are key settings:
```properties
spring.application.name=pawpal
